# LMU Beamer Theme

**This project is aiming to provide users with a beamer theme following the [LMU
corporate design][1].**

## Usage

Copy the project files into your presentation's directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mnm-team/latex-beamer.git
```

Alternatively if you want to install it system-wide or for the current user,
copy the project files into `<TEXMF>/tex/latex/mnm-beamer`.

In your presentation, use the _beamer_ document class and tell it to use the LMU
theme:

```latex
\documentclass[
    compress,   % compresses the navigation into one line
    utf8        % good for using ö,ä,ü,ß,...
]{beamer}

\usetheme{LMU}
```

## Documentation

This project provides the file _lmu-example.tex_. It shows how to use the beamer
theme explicitly and some more things you might want to do in a more technical
presentation.

For general information on presentations with the beamer package reading the
[original documentation][2] is highly recommended. For hacking the LMU theme you
will also need to understand the [PGF/TikZ package][3].

## Status of the Project

This project is in alpha-stage.

This project follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification][4].
